# Circuit Valve ðŸš¦

**Circuit Valve** is a robust TypeScript library for backend services, blending the best of circuit breakers, rate limiters, and retry logic into a single, easy-to-use package. It helps your services stay resilient, avoid overloading dependencies, and gracefully handle failuresâ€”so your systems keep running smoothly, even when things get bumpy!

---

## Why Circuit Valve?

- **Protect your dependencies:** Prevents hammering databases, APIs, or other services when they're struggling.
- **Stay stable under pressure:** Dynamically adjusts request rates and concurrency to match real-world conditions.
- **Fail fast, recover smart:** Circuit breaker logic stops repeated failures and lets you control how and when to try again.
- **Retry with care:** Built-in retry mechanism with smart limits, so you don't make things worse.

---

## Features âœ¨

- **Efficient ring buffer** for tracking recent requests and failures (O(1) operations)
- **Accurate rate limiting** by requests per second and simultaneous requests
- **Circuit breaker** that opens on too many failures, with configurable recovery
- **Soft breaker**: Dynamic rate/concurrency reduction when failures spike, with gradual recovery
- **Customizable retry**: Automatic retries with limits on count, time, and failure rate
- **Event hooks** for logging, monitoring, or alerting
- **Global registry** for stats and integration with observability tools
- **Decorator support**: Use `@ValveGuard('valveName')` to protect class methods or functions with a named valve

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { createValve, RateLimitedException, CircuitBreakerException } from 'circuit-valve';

const valve = createValve({
  name: 'my-db',
  maxReqPerSecond: 10,
  maxSimultaneousRequests: 3,
  controlPeriodS: 5,
  controlPeriodMaxRequests: 50,
  fullCloseAfterNFailures: 5,
  fullCloseDurationS: 30,
  maxRetryCount: 2,
});

// Wrap your async function
const safeQuery = valve.add(async (sql) => {
  // ...call your DB here...
});

try {
  await safeQuery('SELECT * FROM users');
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof RateLimitedException) {
    // Too many requests! Back off and retry later
  } else if (err instanceof CircuitBreakerException) {
    // Circuit is open! Dependency is unhealthy
  } else {
    // Handle other errors
  }
}
```

## Decorator Usage: ValveGuard

You can use the `@ValveGuard('valveName')` decorator to automatically wrap a function or class method with an existing valve from the global registry. This is handy for enforcing rate limits and circuit breaking on service methods or handlers without manual wrapping.

**Example:**

```typescript
import { createValve, ValveGuard } from 'circuit-valve';

createValve({
  name: 'my-db',
  maxReqPerSecond: 10,
  // ...other options...
});

class MyService {
  @ValveGuard('my-db')
  async fetchData(sql: string) {
    // ...call your DB here...
  }
}

// Or for standalone functions:
const safeQuery = ValveGuard('my-db')(async (sql: string) => {
  // ...call your DB here...
});
```

If the valve does not exist, the decorator will throw an error at call time.

## How It Works

- **Rate Limiting:**
  - Set `maxReqPerSecond` and/or `maxSimultaneousRequests`.
  - If limits are exceeded, throws `RateLimitedException` (your function is NOT called).
- **Circuit Breaker:**
  - Opens if too many failures in a row or high failure rate.
  - While open, all calls throw `CircuitBreakerException`.
  - After a cooldown, circuit reopens (optionally with lower limits for a soft start).
- **Soft Breaker:**
  - If failure rate is high, dynamically lowers allowed rates/concurrency.
  - Gradually recovers as things stabilize.
- **Retry:**
  - If enabled, failed calls are retried (with limits on count, time, and failure rate).
- **Stats & Observability:**
  - Each valve is globally registered for stats and can be integrated with monitoring tools.

## Advanced: Event Reporting

You can pass a custom `eventReporter` to receive callbacks for high failure rates, retries, circuit open/close, and rate limiting. A default console reporter is included.
